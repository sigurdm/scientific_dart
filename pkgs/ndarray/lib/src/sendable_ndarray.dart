/// Transmission mode for a [SendableNDArray].
enum _SendableMode { copy, borrow }

/// An isolate-sendable wrapper for [NDArray] enabling cross-isolate data transfer.
///
/// Ordinary [NDArray] instances cannot be directly passed across Dart Isolates
/// (such as via `Isolate.run` or [SendPort]) because:
/// 1. [NDArray] registers an [ffi.NativeFinalizer] token with the isolate-local
///    garbage collector. Passing an object bound to a native finalizer across
///    isolates is forbidden and unsafe.
/// 2. [NDArray] holds references to isolate-specific [ResourceScope] zones and
///    hierarchical view parent chains (`_parent`), which cannot be accessed
///    safely across isolate boundaries.
/// 3. Attaching independent native finalizers to the same unmanaged C pointer
///    across multiple isolates causes race conditions and catastrophic double-free crashes.
///
/// [SendableNDArray] resolves this by providing two explicit transmission modes:
/// - **Copy Mode** ([SendableNDArray.fromCopy] or [NDArray.toSendable]):
///   Copies the array data into a [TransferableTypedData] buffer alongside metadata
///   ([shape] and [dtypeIndex]). When received by another isolate, calling [materialize]
///   reconstructs a fresh, independent, scope-registered [NDArray] that owns its newly
///   allocated native C memory.
/// - **Borrow Mode** ([SendableNDArray.unsafeBorrow] or [NDArray.toSendableBorrow]):
///   Captures the raw native memory address ([address]), [shape], [strides], [dtypeIndex],
///   and [_physicalByteCapacity] without copying. The receiving isolate calls [materializeView]
///   to construct a zero-copy, non-owning view backed by [NDArray.fromPointer] (with no finalizer).
///   The caller is responsible for ensuring that the source array remains alive in its scope
///   on the sending isolate for the duration of the isolate task (for example, by awaiting
///   `Isolate.run` inside an [NDArray.scope]).
///
